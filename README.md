# Deep-fake-image-detection
Detect fake images through the GAN and autoencoder model that are used in this project
If the results are not satisfied, then try training the model with vast and variety of images.
Before testing the sample image, check the precision and accuracy. According to it, change the conditions(< and >) in the test and output code.
Then run the test and print the output.
=> Next Step is to make a GUI.
